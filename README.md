# Todo List

## What is it?

- A todo list for you to keep track of your daily tasks!

## What has it been built with?

### Frontend

Javascript, CSS and HTML

### Backend

Created using Firebase, real-time database. A REST Api is being built for this todo list using CRUD practices

## Why?

- For the frontend I've made a similar todo list using jQuery and wanted to challenge myself with rewriting it using vanilla Javascript
- For the backend I'm implementing Firebase for practice and to learn to use Firebase in projects as opposed to tutorials
